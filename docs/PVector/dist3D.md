# double dist3D()
Gets the 3D Euclidian distance between the current vector and the origin (0, 0, 0).

## Returns
A double representing the Euclidian distance between the current vector and the origin

## Explanation
See [dist3D(PVector)](dist3D_PVector) for a detailed explanation.

## Example
```cpp
PVector v = PVector(3, 4, 1);
v.dist2D(); // Returns sqrt(26)
```
