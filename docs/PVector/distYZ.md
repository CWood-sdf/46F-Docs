Gets the 2D Euclidian distance between the current vector and the origin (0, 0) in the YZ plane.

## Returns
A double representing the Euclidian distance between the current vector and the origin

## Explanation
See [dist2D(PVector)](dist2D_PVector) for a detailed explanation.

## Example
```cpp
PVector v = PVector(0, 3, 4);
v.distYZ(); // Returns 5
```
