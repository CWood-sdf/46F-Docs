# PVector(PVector&& v)
This constructor creates a new PVector by moving the values from the given PVector. This is a move constructor, so the given PVector is left in an undefined state.

This constructor is auto-generated by the compiler, basically what it will do is just copy the given PVector to the new one.

## Parameters
- `v` - The PVector to move

## Example
```cpp
PVector v = PVector(PVector(1.0, 2.0, 3.0));
/*
v.x == 1.0
v.y == 2.0
v.z == 3.0
*/
```
