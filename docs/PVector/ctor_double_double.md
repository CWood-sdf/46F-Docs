# PVector(double x, double y)
This constructor creates a new PVector with the given x and y values. The z value is set to 0.0. There really isn't very much to say about this constructor, it just sets x and y to the parameters. 

## Parameters
- `x` - The x value of the vector
- `y` - The y value of the vector

## Example
```cpp
PVector v = PVector(1.0, 2.0);
/*
v.x == 1.0
v.y == 2.0
v.z == 0.0
*/
```
