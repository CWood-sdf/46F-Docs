# WheelController
This class is the core functionality of lib46f. It is primarily responsible for moving the robot around. It also manages alliance color and switching auton routines based on the color of the alliance. It is designed to be highly customizable and easy to use. 

## Inner Workings
Really, all the interesting stuff about this class happens in just a few functions, namely `turnTo`, `followPath`, and `driveDistance`. All the explanation for these functions can be found on their respective pages.
