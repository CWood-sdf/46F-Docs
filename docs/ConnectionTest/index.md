# ConnectionTest
This is not a class, rather a collection of a function, a macro, and a global variable.

What this does is automatically test the connection between the brain and ALL the declared v5 devices. It also tests motors for overheating. This prints all its data to a very nice screen that can be drawn on the [BrainOS](../BosFn/). This is a very useful tool especially when doing driver training or testing autons because this allows you to quickly debug errors.
