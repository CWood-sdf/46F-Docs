# Bezier functions
A collection of a few functions for bezier curves

## Explanation
Bezier curves are a type of curve defined by multiple "control points." The curve is made by moving a point through the control points. The curve is defined by a parameter `t` which is a number between 0 and 1. The curve is defined by repeated linear interpolation between the control points.
