# enum class AngularVel
This class holds the types of angular velocity units that are used in the `followTo` function. It is used to specify the units of the angular velocity parameter in the `followTo` function.

## Values

### pctDiff
This is the default value. It is the percent differential of the speeds. For further reference: see [Chassis::driveFromDiff](../Chassis/driveFromDiff)

### curvature
This is the curvature for the robot to drive at. For further reference: see [Chassis::driveFromCurvature](../Chassis/driveFromCurvature)

### radps
This is the angular velocity in radians per second. For further reference: see [Chassis::driveFromAngular](../Chassis/driveFromAngular)
